## What this is

**Quantitative-Finance-Lab** is a project series where each topic is developed end-to-end:

- **Clear narrative**: intuition → math → implementation
- **Reproducible experiments**: consistent metrics, plots, and comparisons
- **Library-first engineering**: reusable components are extracted into **`quantfinlab`**

The goal is to build a portfolio that is both **research-grade** (well explained) and **engineering-grade** (reusable, testable, maintainable).

## Start here

- Read the **Overview** for conventions, reproducibility notes, and how projects are structured.
- Then open a project notebook and follow it top-to-bottom.

### 01 — Yield Curve, Bond Pricing & Risk

- Yield curve construction (discount factors / zero rates)
- Bond pricing and key risk measures
- Practical fixed-income utilities you can reuse elsewhere

### 02 — Portfolio Optimization (Mean–Variance)

- Mean–variance optimization pipeline
- Covariance estimators and model comparisons
- Backtest-style evaluation and performance diagnostics

## The `quantfinlab` library

As the series grows, reusable code is consolidated into **`quantfinlab`**:

- shared fixed-income helpers
- portfolio utilities
- plotting/diagnostic helpers
- common conventions (metrics, configs, I/O)

The intent is simple: **notebooks explain and experiment**; **the library implements**.

---

## Reproducibility

- This repo follows a reproducibility-first workflow (formatting/linting/testing/CI).
- Large datasets are typically **not committed**. If a notebook expects data files, place them under a local `data/` directory (gitignored) and follow any project-specific notes.

This repository is for **research and educational purposes**. Nothing here is investment advice, and results may vary by dataset, assumptions, costs, constraints, and implementation details.
