## Purpose

This lab is designed to be a **long-running series** of quantitative finance projects, where each project is:

1. **Readable** (clear narrative, equations, and interpretation)  
2. **Reproducible** (same inputs → same results, consistent metrics)  
3. **Reusable** (core logic extracted into a Python package)

The long-term output is a portfolio of work that demonstrates both **research depth** and **software discipline**.

---

## How projects are structured

Each project is written as a Quarto notebook and typically follows:

1. **Motivation & problem statement**
2. **Mathematical formulation**
3. **Implementation details**
4. **Experiments and comparisons**
5. **Diagnostics + failure modes**
6. **Summary of results & takeaways**

As patterns emerge, reusable components are moved into the **`quantfinlab`** package so future projects can build on stable foundations.

## Repository layout (conceptual)

- `notebooks/`  
  Project notebooks (Quarto). These are the **public-facing** research artifacts.

- `quantfinlab/`  
  Reusable Python library modules shared across projects.

- `docs/`  
  Rendered website output (GitHub Pages).

- `.github/workflows/`, `pyproject.toml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`  
  Code quality + reproducibility tooling (lint/format/tests/CI).

---

## The `quantfinlab` philosophy

The design rule is:

> **Notebooks are clients. The library is the product.**

If code is used in more than one place—or is critical enough to deserve tests—it should live in `quantfinlab`.

Examples of what belongs in the library:
- curve construction helpers, bond pricing primitives, risk measures
- portfolio constraints, optimization wrappers, objective/penalty building blocks
- standardized performance metrics and plotting utilities
- data validation, common transformations, and safe defaults

---

## Data & reproducibility

Many finance datasets are large or licensed, so the repository generally avoids committing raw data.

**Recommended approach**
- Keep datasets in a local `data/` directory (gitignored).
- Use clear filenames and a short data note inside each notebook:
  - required file(s)
  - expected columns
  - frequency and timezone assumptions
  - missing data handling expectations

**Strong reproducibility standard**
- A notebook should either:
  - run end-to-end from a clean clone once data is present, or
  - fail with a clear, friendly message explaining what’s missing and where to put it.

---

## Evaluation conventions (recommended)

To keep comparisons consistent across projects, the lab aims to standardize:

- **Return definition** (close-to-close vs open-to-open, etc.)
- **Rebalance convention** (timing, lookahead prevention)
- **Transaction costs model** (turnover-based, spread-based, fees)
- **Metrics**  
  At minimum: CAGR, volatility, Sharpe, max drawdown, turnover, hit rate  
  When relevant: tail metrics (VaR/CVaR), exposure diagnostics, constraint activity

If a metric can be misleading, the notebook should highlight it and include at least one complementary diagnostic plot/table.

---

## Quality checklist used in this lab

A project is considered “complete” when it includes:

-  clear assumptions and constraints  
-  sanity checks and edge-case discussion  
-  comparison baselines (simple but strong references)  
-  reproducible plots/tables (consistent formatting and labels)  
-  reusable implementation extracted to `quantfinlab` where appropriate  
-  minimal tests for core functions when feasible  

---

## Roadmap (high level)

- Expand the library into clearer submodules (fixed income, portfolio, risk, datasets)
- Add test coverage for high-value finance primitives
- Add standardized experiment configs + results tables at the end of each project
- Add small sample datasets for “out-of-the-box” runs when possible
- Add additional projects in areas like:
  - risk attribution and factor models
  - transaction cost modeling and turnover control
  - robust optimization and regularization
  - stress testing and scenario analysis
  - yield curve strategies and bond portfolio PnL attribution
